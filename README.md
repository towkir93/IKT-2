The IKT-2 lab for CIT student at University of Bremen. 

General Task Description:

The general idea of this lab is the implementation of a complete point-to-point OFDM
communication chain as illustrated in Fig. 2, including transmitter, channel and receiver.
To do so, we summarize the analog bandpass processing in to a baseband model. This
model summarizes all channel and hardware effects that are attributed to bandpass
processing, including but not limited to up/down conversion, amplification, antenna
patterns, and so on. However, some of the bandpass effects will be included into the lab
by equivalent baseband descriptions as “non-linear hardware”.
The baseline OFDM system has to be implemented of the lab according to the specifications
